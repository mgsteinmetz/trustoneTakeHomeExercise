## My App Introduction

This is an app created using React. Designed for the company Trustone Financial Credit Union in part of an interview. 

This app presents a user with a simple form where they are able to enter either a County PIN (property identification number), street number, or street name. 

The app will then return the user with multiple responses, in which align with the users search criteria. These responses will return various output fields including: Owner name, Property address, County name, and Estimated property value.
